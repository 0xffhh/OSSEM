# MITRE ATTACK

MITRE’s Adversarial Tactics, Techniques and Common Knowledge (ATT&CK™) is a curated knowledge base and model for cyber adversary behavior, reflecting the various phases of an adversary’s lifecycle and the platforms they are known to target. ATT&CK is useful for understanding security risk against known adversary behavior, for planning security improvements, and verifying defenses work as expected.

## Data Sources

Data sources defined by the MITRE ATTACK team. These data sources do not necessarily map directly to a physical data set or event log source. Multiple physical data sets can map to the same data source. For example, in the Anti Virus data source, it can be provided by several AV companies.
