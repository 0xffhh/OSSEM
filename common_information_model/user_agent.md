# User Agent Schema

Event fields used to define metadata about the User-Agent header in an application. Most commonly this header/field is seen in HTTP log sources. However, can also be seen in SIP and SMTP.

However, there are many scenarios from log sources where one could not distinguish whether it was the full URL or just the URI.
User Agent data can be seen in various log sources such as SIP, SMTP, [HTTP](http.md) as well as certain other applications such as SIP.
