# Data Dictionaries

This part of the OSSEM project contains specific information about several security event logs organized by operating system. Every dictionary desribes every single log and what their field names mean in each log category. The difference from the common data schema folder is that even though the common standard field names are applied to each log in each dictionary, each field name definition is unique to the specific event log.
