# Windows security audit events

You can use Windows security and system logs to record and store collected security events so that you can track key system and network activities to monitor potentially harmful behaviors and to mitigate those risks. You customize system log events by configuring auditing based on categories of security events such as changes to user account and resource permissions, failed attempts for user logon, failed attempts to access resources, and attempts to modify system files.

Security audit events organized by their categories:

* [Account Logon](https://github.com/Cyb3rWard0g/OSSEM/blob/master/data_dictionaries/data_sensors/windows/security/account-logon.md)
