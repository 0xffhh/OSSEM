# Audit Account Management

## Description

This audit setting determines whether to track management of users and groups. For example, users and groups should be tracked when a user or computer account, a security group, or a distribution group is created, changed, or deleted; when a user or computer account is renamed, disabled, or enabled; or when a user or computer password is changed. An event can be generated for users or groups that are added to or removed from other groups.[Microsoft Source](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/plan/security-best-practices/monitoring-active-directory-for-signs-of-compromise#audit-account-management)
