# Audit Policy Change

## Description

Policy Change audit events allow you to track changes to important security policies on a local system or network. Because policies are typically established by administrators to help secure network resources, monitoring changes or attempts to change these policies can be an important aspect of security management for a network.[Microsoft Source](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/auditing/advanced-security-audit-policy-settings#policy-change)
