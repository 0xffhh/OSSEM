# Audit Distribution Group Management

Audit Distribution Group Management determines whether the operating system generates audit events for specific distribution-group management tasks.

This subcategory generates events only on domain controllers. This subcategory allows you to audit events generated by changes to distribution groups such as the following:

* Distribution group is created, changed, or deleted.
* Member is added or removed from a distribution group.
