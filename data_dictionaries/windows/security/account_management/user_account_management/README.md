# Audit User Account Management

Audit User Account Management determines whether the operating system generates audit events when specific user account management tasks are performed.

This policy setting allows you to audit changes to user accounts. Events include the following:

* A user account is created, changed, deleted, renamed, disabled, enabled, locked out or unlocked.
* A user accountâ€™s password is set or changed.
* A security identifier (SID) is added to the SID History of a user account, or fails to be added.
* The Directory Services Restore Mode password is configured.
* Permissions on administrative user accounts are changed.
* A user's local group membership was enumerated.
* Credential Manager credentials are backed up or restored.
