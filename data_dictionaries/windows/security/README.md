# Windows Security Audit Events

## Description
You can use Windows security and system logs to record and store collected security events so that you can track key system and network activities to monitor potentially harmful behaviors and to mitigate those risks. You customize system log events by configuring auditing based on categories of security events such as changes to user account and resource permissions, failed attempts for user logon, failed attempts to access resources, and attempts to modify system files.

## Sub Data Sets
|events|Description|Tags|
|---|---|---|
|[4610](events/event-4610.md)|This event generates every time Authentication Package has been loaded by the Local Security Authority (LSA). Each time the system starts, the LSA loads the Authentication Package DLLs from HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\Authentication Packages registry value and performs the initialization sequence for every package located in these DLLs.|System, Audit Security System Extension|
|[4611](events/event-4611.md)|This event indicates that a logon process has registered with the Local Security Authority (LSA). Also, logon requests will now be accepted from this source. At the technical level, the event does not come from the registration of a trusted logon process, but from a confirmation that the process is a trusted logon process. If it is a trusted logon process, the event generates. A logon process is a trusted part of the operating system that handles the overall logon function for different logon methods (network, interactive, etc.). You typically see these events during operating system startup or user logon and authentication actions|System, Audit Security System Extension|
|[4614](events/event-4614.md)|This event generates every time a Notification Package has been loaded by the Security Account Manager. In reality, starting with Windows Vista, a notification package should be interpreted as afs Password Filter. Password Filters are DLLs that are loaded or called when passwords are set or changed. Each time a system starts, it loads the notification package DLLs from HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\Notification Packages registry value and performs the initialization sequence for every package.|System, Audit Security System Extension|
|[4616](events/event-4616.md)|This event generates every time system time was changed.|System, Audit Security State Change|
|[4618](events/event-4618.md)|This event is generated when Windows is configured to generate alerts in accordance with the Common Criteria Security Audit Analysis requirements (FAU_SAA) and an auditable event pattern occurs.|System, Audit System Integrity|
|[4622](events/event-4622.md)|This event generates every time Security Package has been loaded by the Local Security Authority (LSA). Security Package is the software implementation of a security protocol (Kerberos, NTLM, for example). Security packages are contained in security support provider DLLs or security support provider/authentication package DLLs. Each time the system starts, the LSA loads the Security Package DLLs from HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\OSConfig\Security Packages registry value and performs the initialization sequence for every package located in these DLLs. It is also possible to add security package dynamically using AddSecurityPackage function, not only during system startup process.|System, Audit Security System Extension|

Domain controllers cache information from recently received tickets. If the server name, client name, time, and microsecond fields from the Authenticator match recently seen entries in the cache, it will return KRB_AP_ERR_REPEAT.
