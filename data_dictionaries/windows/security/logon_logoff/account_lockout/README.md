# Audit Account Lockout

Audit Account Lockout enables you to audit security events that are generated by a failed attempt to log on to an account that is locked out.

If you configure this policy setting, an audit event is generated when an account cannot log on to a computer because the account is locked out. Success audits record successful attempts and failure audits record unsuccessful attempts.
