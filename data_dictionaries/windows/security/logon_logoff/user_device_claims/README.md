# Audit User/Device Claims

Audit User/Device Claims allows you to audit user and device claims information in the accountâ€™s logon token. Events in this subcategory are generated on the computer on which a logon session is created. For an interactive logon, the security audit event is generated on the computer that the user logged on to.

For a network logon, such as accessing a shared folder on the network, the security audit event is generated on the computer hosting the resource.
